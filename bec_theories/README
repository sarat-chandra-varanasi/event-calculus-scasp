bec_original.lp (also bec_theory.lp)
----------------
  Proper ASP encoding of BEC axioms. Ideally this should be the only one used.  
  Suffers from non-termination issues currently when the execution reaches some forall. 

bec_sarat.lp
-------------
 Prolog style execution of BEC axioms. Has no ASP negation-as-failure (NAF) calls, 
 and uses findall instead of forall. Useful debugging aid, but models returned are not 
 precise yet.

 bec_sarat_swi.lp
 -----------------

 Same as bec_sarat.lp but for SWI-Prolog. 


bec_clingo.lp
--------------
 
     SAT-based clingo encoding of BEC. Time is discretized. 

xc_shanahan.lp
---------------
   
    Extended Event Calculus axioms from Shanahan. The axioms are not completely written, 
    and are also written in the style of bec_sarat

causal.lp
----------
    Additional causal axioms modelling fluents affected by simultaneous events, as in Thielscher ciruit. The axioms are written in pure ASP with NAF.


causal_sarat.lp
-----------------
    Same as causal.lp, but written in Prolog style using findall. Has no NAF.
