/*

   This is an abductive meta-interpreter for abduction with negation-as-
   failure, with built-in features for handling event calculus queries.
   In effect this implements a partial-order planner. not(clipped) facts
   correspond to protected links. The planner will also perform
   hierarchical decomposition, given definitions of compound events
   (happens if happens clauses).

   The form of queries is as follows.

        abdemo(Goals,Residue)

   Goals is a list of atoms (goals). Residue is a pair of lists of atoms
   [RH,RB], where RH contains happens facts and RB contains temporal
   ordering facts. Negations is a list of lists of atoms.

   Roughly speaking, the above formulae should hold if,

        EC and CIRC[Domain] and CIRC[ResidueOut] |= Goals

   where EC is the event calculus axioms, CIRC[Domain] is the completion
   of initiates, terminates and  releases, and CIRC[ResidueOut] is the
   completion of happens. (Note that completion isn't applied to temporal
   ordering facts.)

   F is expected to be fully bound when we call abdemo(holds_at(F,T)).
   It's assumed that all primitive actions (two argument happens) are
   in the residue.

   Although the interpreter will work with any logic program, the axioms of
   the event calculus are compiled in to the meta-level.

   The function symbol "neg" is introduced to represent classically
   negated fluents. holds_at(neg(F)) corresponds to not holds_at(F)
   (with classical "not"). terminates formulae play a role in clipping
   positive fluents and initiating negative fluents. Conversely,
   initiates formulae play a role in clipping negative fluents and
   initiating positive ones.

   residue. (Note that, in such cases, we still need to record and

   Note the use of \+ demo_beq(T2,T1) rather than \+ demo_before(T1,T2)
   in demo_naf(clipped). This ensures that "not clipped" fails if there
   exists a linearisation of the actions in the residue which would clip
   the fluent in question.

   In effect, demo_naf(clipped) proves the classical negation of clipped,
   given the completions of clipped, initiates, terminates, releases and
   happens. Likewise, demo_naf(holds_at) proves the classical negation
   of holds_at. Assuming that F is a ground term, to show the classical
   negation of holds_at(F), we simply have to show holds_at(neg(F)), and
   to show the classical negation of holds_at(neg(F)), we show holds_at(F).
   This is justified by the implicit adoption of the axiom,

        not holds_at(F,T) <-> holds_at(neg(F),T)

   where "not" is interpreted classically.

   If F is not a ground term, we can still show demo_naf([holds_at(F)|Gs])
   by showing demo_naf(Gs) for all values of F for which demo(holds_at(F))
   succeeds. (We need to be able to do this to show not(clipped(F)) in the
   presence of terminates clauses with holds_at conditions which supply
   context rather than being preconditions. These will have unbound fluent
   arguments when they are called.) However, this doesn't work in all cases
   and is a potential source of incompleteness.
